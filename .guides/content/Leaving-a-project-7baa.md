You can leave your project at any time

- by clicking on your user name in the top right of the window or at the top of the file tree
- From the Project->Exit menu

All your files are auto-saved so you do not need to explicitly save them. You should be aware that within a few minutes of leaving your project the Box will be shut down and files and services will not longer be accessible. Your project data is still there of course.

When you open your project, the state will be restored and your Box normally restarts in a couple of seconds.

You will be returned to the projects list and you will now find your project at the top of the list. Click on it again to reopen it.
