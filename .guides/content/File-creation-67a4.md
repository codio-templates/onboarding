Let's start off by creating some files. Either right click on the project name in the file tree or go to the File menu to create a file. 

Create the following files (just enter the file name, Codio will detect the language)

- `index.html`
- `test.py`

You can switch between the files by clicking on the tabs above the code. 

Enter the following text into `test.py`

```python
print("Hello world")
```

and this into `index.html`

```html
<!--

<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
Hello world
</body>
</html>
```

### Previewing
You can preview any html file by right-clicking the file in the tree or the code panel tab and selecting 'Preview static'. A new tab will open up and render the file. You can see the box's auto-generated domain name in the url.

### Running the python
The python file can be executed from the command line by opening a terminal window. This is accessed from the Tools->Terminal window. You can see that we've opened a terminal window for you here just to show you what it looks like. You will do this in your own project.
