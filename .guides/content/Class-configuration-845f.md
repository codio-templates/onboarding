Classes are managed from the Classes section of the dashboard.

### Creating new classes
You can create a new class by pressing the '+' button at the top of the page. Give the class a meaningful name and press create.

Create a class called 'My First Class'.

### Adding students
If you are using an LMS platform then assigning students to the class is handled by the LMS/Codio interface automatically. We will not cover LMS integration this at this point in order to understand the 'Codio only' way first.

#### Faculty steps
Making sure you are looking at your class screen as a faculty member ...

- Press the Admin tab within your selected class
- Find the Class Token field and copy this to the clipboard

#### Student steps
Now, as explained in the 'Test Students' section earlier, you should access student's account (or at least one student) in an incognito/private browser window or a different browser. Then follow these steps.

- In the main dashboard, press the 'Join class' button on the left hand side
- Paste the token you just copied from the class screen
- repeat this for the other two test students

Each student will now be a member of two classes. You can switch classes from the Classes dropdown. There will not be anything in the list below as we have not yet assigned any Unit content to this new class.

#### Faculty steps
Now, return to the class screen and reload the browser page. If you click on the Students tab, you should see the three test students successfully added to the class.
