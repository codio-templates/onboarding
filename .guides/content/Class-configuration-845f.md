### Adding students
If you are using an LMS platform then assigning students to the class is handled by the LMS/Codio interface automatically. We will not cover LMS integration this at this point in order to understand the 'Codio only' way first.

#### Faculty steps
Making sure you are looking at your class screen as a faculty member ...

- Press the Admin tab within your selected class
- Find the Class Token field and copy this to the clipboard

#### Student steps
Now, as explained in the 'Test Students' section earlier, you should access student's account (or at least one student) in an incognito/private browser window or a different browser. Then follow these steps.

- In the main dashboard, press the 'Join class' button on the left hand side
- Paste the token you just copied from the class screen
- repeat this for the other two test students

As we auto-created a class for your trial and assigned some students to it you may see that the student is a member of two classes. You can switch classes from the Classes dropdown. You should see the following screen.
