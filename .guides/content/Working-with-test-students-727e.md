You can work with special test students at any time. Codio creates three special test student accounts that allows you to switch between a teacher view and a student view without the hassle of creating test accounts yourself and having to repeatedly log in and out.

- Select your Codio class.
- Click on the **Students** tab near the top of the page.
- Now click the large blue **+** button.

- You will now see all three test students (unless you removed any test students) added to your class.

### Logging in as a test student
As soon as you have added the test students, you are able to log in as one of the test students by pressing the **Login as** button. Please note that this is only available for the special test student accounts.

For these special accounts, you do not need to actually login with a user name and password. Instead, you are taken directly to the **My Classroom** dashboard.

Initially, this screen will not have any data. Once you start assigning Units (coming soon) to your class, you will see information appearing here.

Note the bar at the top of the screen, letting you know that you are logged in as a test student.

### Switching back to the teacher
You can switch back to your main teacher account in either of these two ways

- Press the **Switch back to teacher account** button at the top of the page. 
- Log out of the test student account.
