It is useful for faculty to know whether a Unit has been completed by a student. This is then shown in the Unit dashboard.

There are two ways for a student to mark a Unit as completed

- In the student dashboard, locate the Unit within the main listing and enabled the 'Mark as completed' switch or 
- within the project itself, select the 'Education->Mark as completed' menu item.

You should note that once a Unit has been marked as completed by the student ...

- The Unit becomes read-only
- The only way to reset this is for the teacher to reset it by going to the class Unit, locating the student and then disabling the switch to the left of the student name.

### Resetting the completed flag
When students mark the unit as complete they get a warning telling them that once set they will not be able to make any further changes to the project. This can behavior be overriden by changing the unit settings in the class.

The teacher is able to reset the completed flag as follows.

- Select the class.
- Select the unit.
- A green check mark will appear next to those students who have marked the unit as completed.
- Hover over the student and you will see a switch appear. Change the switch so the check mark is removed and the student can access the unit again.


### Marking all students as completed
There are reasons why faculty might want to mark all students' Units as complete. We describe such an example below.

To do this

- Select the class
- Select the unit
- Press the **Action** button. 
- You will find a button beneath **Mark All as Completed**.

### Auto-grading when marked as completed
An advanced Codio feature lets the Unit author include an auto-grading script that executes when the student marks the project as complete. It is beyond the scope of this Onboarding Guide to detail this here but you can [find details in our documentation](https://codio.com/docs/teacher/classes/autograde/) if interested.
