We create 3 test student accounts when your start your trial. The signin details for these accounts were emailed to you. You should have these students' email addresses and passwords available as we will be using them later on.

You can create additional test student accounts at any time. We recommend that you follow these principles when doing so.

- Use a single email address and use the '+' symbol to create unique accounts. If, for example, your email address is `johndoe@domain.com` then you can create additional students using `johndoe+1@domain.com`, `johndoe+2@domain.com`. Most email systems accept this and it is much easier than creating extra accounts the usual way.
- When accessing a student account, which we cover later, use either an incognito/private browser window or use a different browser type. You cannot have more than one account open within the same browser unless you are in incognito/private mode.
