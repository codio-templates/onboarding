Codio automatically manages up to three test student accounts. This is extremely useful for allowing teachers to switch over to a test student without having to log out as a teacher, log in as a student and then in again as a teacher.

### Checking the test students
You can find the test student accounts as follows. You will need to be an organization owner.

If you remove any of the tests students, you can restore all three at any time using the button.
