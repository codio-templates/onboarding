From January 24th, 2017, Codio automatically creates 3 test student for your organization. The user that created the trial will have been sent the email addresses and passwords for those accounts. 

If you created your trial before this date or want to add more test students then skip to the next page to manually add test students.

## LMS Platforms
When you are in production and if you use an LMS platform then the Codio/LMS integration takes care of all student account creation. However, during the onboarding phase we stringly recommend using the procedure outlined in this Guide. We address the LMS setup later in this Guide.

## Checking for existing students
Please follow these steps to find out which students have been created. These steps will only work if you are an organization owner. If you are not, then please ask the organization owner to promote you to being an owner during the onboarding phase.

- Click on your user name at the bottom left of the Codio dashboard
- Click on the organization name at the bottom of the next page underneath **My Organizations**.
- Scroll down to the **Organization Teams** section and look for the **Students** item.
- Click on this item and you will see the following screen.

The organization owner will need to provide you with the passwords for each of these users so you can log in. 

## Try logging in
At this point it is a good idea to check that you can log in to a test student account. 

If you want to work as both faculty/teacher and a student simultaneously then you should follow these steps as Codio does not allow you to be logged in as 2 different users in the same browser.

- Log in as faculty/teacher (which is probably the case now) in your main browser.
- Then, *either* open a new browser type *or* open an incognito/private browser window.
- Finally, login to this second browser as the student.
