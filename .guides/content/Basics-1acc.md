We won't go deep into content authoring using Guides, but we will do just enough to allow you to create some simple assessments. These will be useful when we assign the project to the class.

## Guides
Both tutorial content and auto-graded assessments need to be authored using Guides.

[Watch this short video](https://vimeo.com/200593228) for a brief overview of Guides authoring first.

Now open up the Guides editor from the Tools->Guides->Edit menu.

### Demo project and documentation
The **Demo Guides and Assessments** project in My Projects contains a section on the full range of text formatting capabilities within guides as well as more advanced assessment examples. It is not necessary to look at this now but you may want to later. If, for any reason, you do not see this in your My Projects list, then [click here](https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/cc68d38b-b0ea-4825-9814-46a3594c2b11/) to create this from a Codio Starter Pack. Click the **Use Pack** button to create a new project from it.

To get full details about Guides, please [refer to the documentation](https://codio.com/docs/content/authoring/).

## Reference
Below is a quick reference of the key Guides editing features for future reference.

### Page navigation
Use the arrows in the toolbar or press the 'Hamburger' icon (the icon with 3 bars on the right hand side of the toolbar) to open the page viewer. You can select a page from this.

### Adding sections and pages
Press the hamburger icon and the 'Add section' button at the bottom of the page adds a new page. 

### Reordering pages
Press the hamburger icon and then drag a page up or down the pages list.

### Settings
Many setting are accessed by pressing the Settings button in the Guide editor toolbar.

### Panel layout
Within setting and on the Page tab you will find the Layout dropdown. Choose one of these for the currently selected page. If you select 'previous' then it will use last explicitly defined page layout.

### Opening code, previews and terminal windows
Within settings you should select the Open Tabs tab. You can then add files, preview windows or terminal commands to execute. Panel 0 refers to the first panel from the left, excluding the Guides content itself.

### Closing panels
On the main settings page, enabling Close Tabs will ensure that any tabs opened by Guides are closed when the current page is shown.

### Teacher only information
You can define pages that are only shown to teachers by enabling the Teacher Only switch. You can also define teacher only content within the page by enclosing the content as follows

```
||| guidance
Teacher only content from her here until
...
|||
```
