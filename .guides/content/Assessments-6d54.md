### Creating new assessments
All assessments are created form the dropdown menu in the Guides toolbar with the rool chesspiece icon.

### Editing an existing assessment
If an assessment is already shown on the page then you must edit it from the same dropdown menu. The existing ones will be listed at the bottom. Click on it to open the dialog.
