## Demo project
The **Demo Guides and Assessments** project in My Projects shows how to create standard and advanced assessment examples. It is not necessary to look at this now but you may want to later.

If, for any reason, you do not see this in your My Projects list, then [click here](https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/cc68d38b-b0ea-4825-9814-46a3594c2b11/) to create this from a Codio Starter Pack. Click the **Use Pack** button to create a new project from it.

### Creating new assessments
All assessments are created form the dropdown menu in the Guides toolbar with the rool chesspiece icon.

### Editing an existing assessment
If an assessment is already shown on the page then you must edit it from the same dropdown menu. The existing ones will be listed at the bottom. Click on it to open the dialog.
