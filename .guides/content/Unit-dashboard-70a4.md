Now that the student have made some changes we can monitor student progress from the Unit dashboard.

Make sure your class is selected and the Units tab is selected within it. Then ...

- Notice how the Unit listing shows you how many students have started the Unit
- Select the Unit to see more details
- You can see the following
  - how much time a student has spent within the Unit
  - their auto-graded scoring
  - whether the student has completed the unit (the left columm shows this but the student has probably not set this yet)

As a faculty member, you have full permissions on the student's box including terminal access.

Feel free to return to the student account in your other browser window and see what changes the teacher may have made.
