Here we explain how to add an existing student to a class or create new students and add them to the class.

## The class invite URL
The class invite url is a url that you can pass to students for joining a class and signing up if not already signed up.

- Select the class.
- Select the **Admin** tab. 
- Look for **Class Invite URL** and copy the url to the clipboard.
- Go to an incognito/private window or open a different browser type.
- Go to codio.com and make sure you are not signed in as a user. If you are then sign out.
- Paste in the url you just copied to the clipboard
- If you want to add an existing student to the class then supply that student's details ...
- ... or if you want to create a new student then supply a new email address using the email address approach described below.


## Using the + email approach
This technique means that you do not have to use a different email address for each test student and can stick to using just one. Most email servers work fine with this. If, for any reason, your institution's server does not allow this then use another email account that does.

- Use a single email address with the '+' symbol to create unique accounts. If, for example, your email address is `johndoe@domain.com` then you can create additional students using `johndoe+student1@domain.com`, `johndoe+student2@domain.com`. Most email systems accept this and it is much easier than creating extra accounts the usual way.

## Signed in as a student
Once you are signed in as a student, you should see a screen like the one below. If this student is a member of more than one class, you may need to change the **Class** dropdown.

## Check the students
Once you have added students to the class, you should check your faculty/teacher classroom view. Return to the class screen and reload the browser page. If you click on the Students tab, you should see the test students successfully added to the class.
