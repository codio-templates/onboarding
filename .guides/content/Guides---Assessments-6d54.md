## Demo project
The Demo Guides and Assessments project in My Projects contains a section on the full range of text formatting capabilities within guides as well as more advanced assessment examples. It is not necessary to look at this now but you may want to later.

### Creating new assessments
All assessments are created form the dropdown menu in the Guides toolbar with the rool chesspiece icon.

### Editing an existing assessment
If an assessment is already shown on the page then you must edit it from the same dropdown menu. The existing ones will be listed at the bottom. Click on it to open the dialog.
