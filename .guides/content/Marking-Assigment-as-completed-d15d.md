It is useful for faculty to know whether an assignment has been completed by a student. This is then shown in the assignment dashboard.

There are two ways for a student to mark an assignment as completed

- In the student dashboard, locate the assignment within the main listing and enabled the 'Mark as completed' switch or 
- within the project itself, select the **'Education->Mark as completed'** menu item.

You should note that once an assignment has been marked as completed by the student ...

- The assignment becomes read-only
- There are 2 ways for a teacher to reset this. By going to the course assignment, locating the student and then disabling the switch to the left of the student name or by [accessing students work](https://codio.com/docs/classes/monitor/student) and going to the 'Education' menu item within the IDE where the teacher can 'Mark as Incomplete'


### Resetting the completed flag
When students mark the assignment as complete they get a warning telling them that once set they will not be able to make any further changes to the project. This can behavior can be overriden by changing the assignment settings in the class.

The teacher is able to reset the completed flag as follows.

- Select the course.
- Select the assignment.
- A green check mark will appear next to those students who have marked the assignment as completed.
- Hover over the student and you will see a switch appear. Change the switch so the check mark is removed and the student can access the assignment again.
- [Access the students work](https://codio.com/docs/classes/monitor/student) and go to the 'Education' menu item within the IDE where you can 'Mark as Incomplete'


### Marking all students as completed
There are reasons why faculty might want to mark all students' assignments as complete. We describe such an example below.

To do this

- Select the course
- Select the assignment
- Press the **Action** button. 
- You will find a button beneath **Mark All as Completed**.

### Auto-grading when marked as completed
An advanced Codio feature lets the assignment author include an auto-grading script that executes when the student marks the project as complete. It is beyond the scope of this Onboarding Guide to detail this here but you can [find details in our documentation](https://codio.com/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/autograde/) if interested.
