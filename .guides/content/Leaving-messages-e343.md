Many organizations decide to implement their own messaging protocols using simple files. The best way to achieve this is to create files that the student can open, read and even edit. 

The following steps show a way of doing this although you can vary it as you like and even have multiple messaging files.

- Create a file `feedback.md`
- Switch to edit mode by pressing the pencil icon within this window.
- Leave some comments. You can use normal markdown formatting as with Guides content editing if you like.

The student can enter a dialog by modifying this file, too. This messaging apprach has it drawbacks (the student can change what the faculty say for example) but it is very effective for most purposes.

Play around with changes and messages made by faculty and students.
