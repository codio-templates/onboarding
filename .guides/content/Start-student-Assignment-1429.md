Let's now sign in to a test student account to get a feel for the student experience.

- Select the course
- Click on the **Students** tab near the top of the page
- If you already added test students to this class, you will see them listed. If not, then add them as described a couple of pages back **Adding test students**.

Once you have added an assignment to your course, when you press the **Login as** button, you will see the test student's dashboard.

If you did not pin the assignment, explained on the previous page, then you will not see the large box at the top showing a maximum of 3 pinned assignments but you will still see the assignment near the bottom of the page.

You can now start the assignment by clicking **ready to go** in the pinned box or in the listing.
