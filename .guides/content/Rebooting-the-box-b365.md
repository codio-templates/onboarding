If, for any reason, you need to reboot the box then you can do so from the Project->Restart Box menu. 

Leaving the project and loading it again does not do this as it can take several minutes for the box to be shut down and if you return to the project immediately, any services that were running beforehand will still be running.

The restart shouldn't take more than about 10 - 15 seconds.
