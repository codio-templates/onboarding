### Stack selection
Codio offers you a range of commonly used stacks to get you started. You should be aware that you can also create your own stacks using one of the defaults as a starting point and then install and configure any other components from the command line. The custom configured stack can then be snapshotted and added to your Stacks template library. You can then reuse it as a custom starting point for future projects.

You will notice that there is a 'Click here' link below the stack buttons. If you like, you can explore this and see some advanced options for creating the project. We won't explain these here.

### Project name
You should give your project a name. Enter "My First Project" then press enter or the Create button to fire up your server and we can start work on our project.
