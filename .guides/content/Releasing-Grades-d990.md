Manual Unit grades are withheld from students until the teacher wishes to releases them. 

If you are using an LMS, all grades including auto-graded results are not posted back to the LMS grade book until grades are explicitly released.

To release grades, follow these steps ...

- Select the Unit within the class
- Locate the 'Actions' button near the top
- Locate the 'Release Grades' switch in the set of options that appear and enable it

At this point, all grades will be released. If you are using an LMS and there any any changes to manual grading scores, then you should disable this and re-enable it again.
