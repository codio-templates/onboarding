Let's now sign in to a student account to get a feel for the student experience.

If you want to work as both faculty/teacher and a student simultaneously then you should follow these steps as Codio does not allow you to be logged in as 2 different users in the same browser.

- Have the faculty/teacher account open (which is probably the case now) in your main browser.
- Then, *either* open a new browser type *or* open an incognito/private browser window.
- Finally, login to this second browser as the student.

Once logged in, you should find the Unit we just assigned in the previous step. If you pinned the Unit then the student will see it with a star in the top area. If you did not, then you can also find it in the bottom listing (make sure the correct class is selected in the leftmost dropdown).

You can now fire up the Unit by pressing 'Ready to Go' in either.

### Change a few things
If you created a Guide in your project, the Guide will have started. Make the following changes to the student assignment.

- Open up the `index.html` file and make a few changes.
- Do the same for `test.py`.
- Navigate through the Guide pages and complete the MCQ and code tests (if you created them in your project).

Repeat this for the other test students if you like.
