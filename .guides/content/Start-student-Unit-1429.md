In your student account, look for the Unit we just assigned in the previous step and click the Ready to Go button. This will fire up the student project.

If that you created a Guide in your project, you will now see the Guide auto-started. Make the following changes to the student assignment.

- Open up the `index.html` file and make a few changes.
- Do the same for `test.py`.
- Navigate through the Guide pages and complete the MCQ and code tests (if you created them in your project).

Repeat this for the other test students if you like.
