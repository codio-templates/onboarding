Any Unit can be manually graded by any of the faculty (anyone added to the Teachers list in the class Admin tab). There are two ways to manually grade a project

- The most effective way is to open the student code from the dashboard, review the work and then select the Education->Grading menu item.
- From the student dashboard, with the Unit selected, press the Grading icon.

Note that students will not see their grade yet. Please refer to the 'Releasing grades' page for more details on this.

## Grading Rubric
A grading rubric is a grid that explains to the person grading exactly how to grade the assignment. Grading rubrics are beyond the scope of this Onboarding Guide but you can [find details in our documentation](https://codio.com/docs/teacher/assess/rubric/).
