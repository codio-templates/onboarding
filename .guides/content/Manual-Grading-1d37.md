Any assignment can be manually graded by any of the faculty (anyone added to the Teachers list in the class Admin tab). There are two ways to manually grade a project

- The most effective way is to open the student code from the dashboard, review the work and then select the Education->Grading menu item.
- From the student dashboard, with the assignment selected, press the Grading icon.

Note that students will not see their grade yet. Please refer to the 'Releasing grades' page following this page for more details on this.

If you are using auto-graded assessment in the assignment, when the assignment is marked as completed by the student, it will automatically calculate a final grade with a percentage value assigned. You can still grade this manually, in which case you will overwrite any auto-assigned grade.

## Grading Rubric
A grading rubric is a grid that explains to the person grading exactly how to grade the assignment. Grading rubrics are beyond the scope of this Onboarding Guide but you can [find details in our documentation](https://codio.com/docs/classes/classmanagement/rubric/).
