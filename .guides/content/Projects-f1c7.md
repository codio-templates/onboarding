A project or 'Box' is the most important entity in Codio. A project has the following main properties

- It is a fully fledged Ubuntu server
- A browser based IDE is always your window onto the server.
- You can open any number of terminal windows to access the command line
- You have sudo level access privileges
- A code editor with syntax highlighting and many other IDE features
- Web facing with a friendly, auto-generated domain name
- A wide range of ports

With a very few exceptions, you can do, install or configure anything on a Codio Box that you can do on a normal Ubuntu server.

Projects are the basis for almost everything you will do within Codio. 

### Coding projects
At its most basic level, faculty or students can create projects for coding. There is no limit to the number of projects that you can create. Unlike a local instance where you have to worry about component conflicts, versions and many other configuration issues, being able to instantly create a server and code anything on it that is fully isolated from all other projects can be a great advantage.

### Templating and distribution
Because all projects live in the Cloud, sharing projects is easy and instant. And having the IDE always loaded means that you can dive into coding without figuring very much out. If you read the section on Starter Packs you will find even better ways of templating projects.

### Assessment configuration
Codio has an extremely powerful set of auto-graded assessment capabilities (multiple choice and auto-graded code tests). Codio Guides provides everything you need to scaffold these.

### Course unit creation
Later, we will look at how you can publish units of content that can contain simple projects, assessments or rich tutorial content. All of these are managed within a projects.

### Tutorial authoring
If you want to use Codio Guides, you have access to a full range of tutorial authoring features along with course publishing support.
