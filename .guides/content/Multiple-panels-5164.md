When users move beyond the novice stage, it is nice for them to be able to move beyond a single code panel to edit in. Faculty will appreciate this from day one.

The View->Layouts and View->Panels menu allows users to control the number of panels shown within the IDE. 

We recommend trying out these options and getting used to using the keyboard shortcuts so you can quickly adjust the layout to your needs.
