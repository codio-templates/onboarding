Here we explain how to add an existing student to a course or create new students and add them to the course.

If you just want to test the student experience, then we recommend you read the previous page as it is far easier and quicker. 

## The course invite URL
The course invite url is a url that you can pass to students for joining a course and signing up if not already signed up.

- Select the course.
- Select the **Admin** tab. 
- Look for **Course Invite URL** and copy the url to the clipboard.
- You can now use this url directly (read below), send it out to people via email or put it in a web page.

## LMS Features
If you are using an LMS platform for real courses, then we suggest you try out the LMS features later, not while onboarding with Codio. You will find an LMS section later in this guide.

## Trying out real student accounts
We would not recommend you do this at this stage. If you really want to, then please be aware of the following.

- You cannot be logged in as more than one Codio user in a browser. The last login will prevail.
- You can work around this restriction by opening an incognito/private window or open a different browser type.
- Go to `codio.com` and make sure you are not signed in as a user. If you are then sign out.
- Paste in the course invite url you copied to the clipboard earlier.
- If you want to add an existing student to the course then supply that student's details ...
- ... or if you want to create a new student then supply a new email address using the email address approach described below.


## Signed in as a student
Once you are signed in as a student, you should see a screen like the one below. If this student is a member of more than one course, you may need to change the **course** dropdown.

## Check the students
Once you have added students to the course, you should check your faculty/teacher course view. Return to the course screen and reload the browser page. If you click on the Students tab, you should see the test students successfully added to the course and as your real students join the class fro the Course Invite URL, they will then appear
