There are a variety of settings that you can make to control your the IDE behavior and appearances.

## Project settings
The project settings can be found in the Project->Settings menu. [Click here for full documentation](https://codio.com/docs/ide/customization/project-settings/).

There are some settings that are worth calling out at this point.

### Private / public
By default, a project is private to you. If you make it public, then anyone with the link to your project will have read-only access to it. Read about project permissions, below, to find out how to grant write and admin access to your project.

### Box cloning
If you enable this, then anyone with access to your project is able to fork your project (described on the next page) will be able to clone both the workspace code and the entire box into their own account. The only reason not to enable this option is if you have sensitive information in the stack. 


## Project Permissions
You can allow specific Codio users to access your projects, even if the project is private, with the following access levels

- **Read** : read-only access to all workspace files, no command line access
- **Write** : workspace files can be modified, no command line access
- **Admin** : workspace files can be modified, full command line access

## Preferences
Preferences refer to general IDE settings. There are a very large number of settings available and these are best viewed by accessing the settings themselves. [Additional documentation is available here](https://codio.com/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs/).

There are two sets of identical preferences you can set. They are accessed form the Codio->Preferences menu.

- **User** : the settings you make here are the defaults that apply to the user. 
- **Project** : these settings are overrides. If anyone forks (next page) the project then these settings will be applied regardless of the settings in that user's own account.

The most commonly used user settings, such as font sizes and themes are accessible from the lower portion of the View menu.
