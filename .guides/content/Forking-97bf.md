Forking creates a copy of a project. This can be just the code workspace or the entire box. You can for your own or someone else's project. 

You first need to open the project you wish to fork. If it is your own then just open it. If you want to fork someone else's project then you need the url of that project or to have it opened from the 'Shared' tab in the projects listing in the dashboard.

To start the forking process, select the Project->Fork menu item. If the project allows box cloning then you will see the following dialog. If not, you will only see the 'Only Project' button.

### Box and Project
If the owner of the source project has enabled 'Enable box cloning' then you will only be allowed to fork the project workspace. If they have enabled it then you can choose whether to fork the entire box, just the stack configuration or the entire project.

If you want to fork the entire box, including the stack, but you are not seeing the options then you will need to contact the owner of the project and ask them to enable 'Allow box cloning' from the Project->Settings menu.

The forking process can take a while, especially if you are forking the entire box and it has a lot of extra components installed.

It will be helpful to read the section on Stacks for more background information.
