There are, generally speaking, two types of GUI based applications, namely Web applications and desktop applications. Web applications do not need any special consideration as they render within the browser.

Desktop applications operate by rendering output to a screen desktop. Codio boxes run in the Cloud and obviously do not have local graphics cards or screens.

Applications can either be a 3rd party application you install in whatever way is appropriate or they can be code you are developing on the box.

If you are writing your own applications then you can use the normal frameworks that you would if developing on your normal desktop. Tkinter, Qt, Swing, JavaFX and other frameworks will all work fine. Please be aware that you will need to install these frameworks on your box yourself from the command line. 

### Documentation and Demo project
[Full documentation can be found here](https://docs.codio.com/ide/boxes/#gui-based-output). 

A sample GUI example project, **Demo GUI Output** can be found in My Projects in the Codio Dashboard. If, for any reason, you do not see this in your My Projects list, then [click here](https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/d9c00215-ec2a-46e7-b64e-85fab45b0872/) to create this from a Codio Starter Pack. Click the **Use Pack** button to create a new project from it.
