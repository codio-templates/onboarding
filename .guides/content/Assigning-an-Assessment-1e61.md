 We are now ready to assign some content to the course. 
 
## An Assessment
In Codio, a teaching assessment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assessment is entirely up to you but it could be a project assignment that a course works on. It could also be some tutorial content built using Guides. We generally recommend that it relates reasonably closely to a lesson or two. But if you prefer and it suits your structure better then you can assign as much or as little content to a Unit as you like.
 
 There are two ways you can assign an assessment to a course.
 
### Assign a project
The simplest and quickest thing you can do is to assign one of your projects to a course. Once assigned, we refer to it as an assessment but the assessment's source is simply a project.

- With the course selected, click on the Assessment tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.
- Now click the **+** button in the top left.
- Select **Add project as unit**
- Select the project we have been working on
- At this point you can start the assignment process, which take just a second or two

At this point, we take a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the Unit. Any changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student Unit.

Once assigned to the course, each student will be able to access the Unit from their dashboard. Go to (or open up) your student in another browser window and refresh the page. Make sure you have the correct course selected form the dropdown. You will now see the Unit in the list. If you don't, make sure the Course dropdown has 'Ad Hoc Projects' selected.  

### Pinning a Unit
One very useful feature is to 'pin' the Unit. This allows the faculty member to pin the Unit to the top of the students' dashboards so it is easy to find.

If you have just assigned the new Unit then you will see your new project as the only project in the list below. To the right of the list item is an icon with three blue dots. Click on this and then select the 'Pin Unit' option.

Now return to the student and reload the page. You will see the unit pinned in the top bar.

### Assigning a Course Module
Courses are a great way to assign multiple Units to a course in one go. For this to be relevant you first need to have your content organized as a course. 

We will not attempt to cover course creation here but just show you how to assign existing course materials to the course. Please look for the 'Course creation' page within this Guide for more details.

Please follow these steps.

- From your Codio dashboard, select the course
- Click the '+' button in the top left
- Select 'Add Module'
- You will now see a course browser. If not already selected, select the 'Recommended' tab
- Select the course 'Introduction to programming'
- Select one of the course modules
- Press the select button

You will see how all of the Units have now been assigned to the course.
