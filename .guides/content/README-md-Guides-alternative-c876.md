An alternate way to give instructions to the student is to create a README.md file. This is a lightweight approach to creating instructions and the student can open and close it as needed. The README.md file will automatically open the first time the student accesses the project.

Just create a new file in your main workspace folder and name is `README.md`. You can switch between edit and view modes using the buttons within the window.
