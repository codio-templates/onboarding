It is very important that new faculty do not create new accounts by signing up for a trial themselves or they will not be correctly assigned to your organization.

To add new faculty to the organization you must send them an invitation. This is done as follows

- Click on your user name at the bottom left.
- You will now be shown your personal account screen. You should select the organization name at the bottom of the Overview tab (which should be showing by default).
- You will now see how you can invite a new faculty member. You can also make them an owner by checking the box.
